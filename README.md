Hi there I built a solar powered robot from using parts from this website : https://owirobot.com/14-in-1-educational-solar-robot-replacement-parts/?srsltid=AfmBOops8YLGpGnpScdN3b2XcGDKjikdJLMqR3tNrx2JCvd4bZe9_QY8 You can run it with a small solar pannel with springs and a instantaneous motor. It runs under the sun on most sunny days (not covered by clouds) alternativly if its rainy or cloudy in your location you can run it from a 10 - 100W led bulb as shown in the video. Note if the bulb is closer to 10W you may need to position the led closer to the solar pannel
